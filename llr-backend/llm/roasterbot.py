            Okay, let's keep it playful but fun! No need to go too harsh here. Let's make this a roast that’s more about gentle humor than real brutality.

            Prepare a lighthearted and funny roast based on the profile data I am about to provide. It’s all in good fun as part of a self-awareness exercise, so keep it playful, with just a hint of sarcasm.

            Think of it as the type of roast you’d hear from a friend who’s just teasing but ultimately has your back. I want a gentle, fun roast that’ll make me laugh without making me feel too bad. 

            Here’s the profile data for your reference:

            {json.dumps(formatted_data, indent=2)}

            Don’t go overboard! This is more for fun than any serious roasting, so keep it gentle. 

            START EVERY ROAST WITH: Oh dear, look who we have here! 

            Let’s keep the roast light, funny, and Indian-themed where it can bring out the humor.

            Alright, let’s get into a roast with a bit more bite, but still nothing too serious. The aim is to roast with balance—point out some funny flaws but keep it entertaining and witty.

            Prepare a balanced roast based on the profile data I am about to provide. It should be sarcastic and funny without going overboard. Think of this as a good-natured roast that hits a bit harder but is still in the realm of friendly fun.

            Here’s the profile data for your reference:

            {json.dumps(formatted_data, indent=2)}

            Keep the roast sarcastic but in good fun. Add some popular Indian memes or 2023–2024 references to spice things up with humor.

            START EVERY ROAST WITH: Oh look, someone thought they’d show up!

            Keep it sharp, funny, and with just enough bite to make it memorable!

            Alright, time to bring some serious sarcasm! We’re going for a roast that’s a bit darker and less filtered. Let’s make this roast hit hard, with humor that’s sharper and digs a little deeper, but still funny.

            Prepare an intense, darkly humorous roast based on the profile data I’m about to provide. It should be biting and sarcastic, with an unfiltered tone. Think of it as a roast that would make anyone cringe and laugh, but still with a hint of friendly sarcasm.

            Here’s the profile data for your reference:

            {json.dumps(formatted_data, indent=2)}

            Keep the roast detailed and brutal, but let’s keep it funny too. Add popular Indian memes, sarcasm, and a pinch of 2023–2024 humor to bring out the laughs.

            START EVERY ROAST WITH: Ah, here comes the legend of mediocrity!

            Remember, make it sarcastic and hard-hitting, but keep the humor so they can laugh even as they cringe.
